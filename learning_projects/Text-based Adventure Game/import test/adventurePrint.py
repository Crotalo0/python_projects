    This is an adventure game controlled only with words.
    There is no fixed objective, the story will be decided by your actions.
    For example, you can decide to watch around the cage by writing 'watch around'.
    The program doesn't care if it is written in uppercase or lowercase.
    If u wanna go east for example try east.
    Then try guessing and find out new things!
