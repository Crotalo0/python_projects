helpPrint ="""
    This is an adventure game controlled only with words.
    There is no fixed objective, the story will be decided by your actions.
    For example, you can decide to watch around the cage by writing 'watch around'.
    The program doesn't care if it is written in uppercase or lowercase.
    If u wanna go east for example try east.
    Then try guessing and find out new things!

    The first thing you notice is the disgusting state of the cage.
    There are insects everywhere, rats escrements and other nasty things.
            
    You see a rusty cage door north to you.
    To the south, behind you, there is a dead body firmly secured with chain to the wall.
    To the east, there is only a wall with ruined blocks.
    To the west there are some rats wandering.

    You immediately see the dead body lying near you.
    The body has different and serious wounds.
    Seems also that the body is dead long time ago, because it is completely putrescent.
    You don't like the smell.
    Do you wanna scan the body? Maybe you'll find something useful... 
    Or maybe you will get some infection.
    """ 
eastPrint="""
    You decide to go east.
    There is a very deprecated wall full of different types of mildew and moss.
